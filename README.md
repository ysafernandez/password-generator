# Password Generator 
## Description 
I created a random password generator based on the criteria needed to suceed for this challenge by demonstrating knowledge on JavaScript. The user can select a password length of 8-128 characters and the option to include: numbers, special characters, lowercase and/or uppercase letters. The user can press "ok" to include or "cancel" to exclude the options. This random password generator can create a strong password that provides greater security.
